# website-with-custom-carousel

First website I ever built (my third and final career change). I started from HTML and CSS templates which I ended up reworte 90% of them. 

The home page is simple (took me a while for my first build; ensuring the right styling, position, and feature is time consuming; great learning experience).  The search box is not fully functioning.  It acts more like a dropdown for now.

HOW TO get to the webpage with custom carousel:
1) go directly to the designer.html
or from index.html...
1) type "UX D" in the search box
2) click on "UX Designer" in the dropdown list
3) my custom carousel is right below the header

NEXT STEPS:
+ separate carousel section from main.js and create a carousel.js. (completed)
+ complete career path map (in progress)
+ figure out how svg works and change its color other than black (in progress)
+ refract HTML so all li tags are JS driven instead of hard code
+ revisit serch box code and css so it can be more of a component
+ convert all to React.js
  
I welcome your feedback.
Thanks.
