# website-with-custom-carousel

First website I ever built (my third and final career change). I started from HTML and CSS templates which I ended up reworte 90% of them. 

The home page is simple (took me a while for my first build; ensuring the right styling, position, and feature is time consuming; great learning experience).  The search box is not fully functioning.  It acts more like a dropdown for now.

HOW TO get to the webpage with custom carousel:
1) type "UX D" in the search box
2) click on "UX Designer" in the dropdown list
3) my custom carousel is right below the header

NEXT STEPS:
+ split main.js into 2 js.  one for index.html the other for detail page (i.e. designer)
+ complete career path map
+ figure out how svg works and change its color other than black
+ refract HTML so all <li> are JS driven instead of hard code
+ revisit serch box code and css so it can be more of a component
+ convert all to React.js
  
I welcome your feedback.
Thanks.
