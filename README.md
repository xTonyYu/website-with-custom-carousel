# website-with-custom-carousel

First website I built that started from HTML and CSS tmeplates that I ended up only reworte 95% of them.

The home page is simple (took me a while for my first build; ensuring the right styling, position, and feature is time consuming; great learning experience).  The search box is not fully functioning.  It acts more like a dropdown for now.

HOW TO get to the webpage with custom carousel:
1) type "UX D" in the search box
2) click on "UX Designer" in the dropdown list
3) my custom carousel is right below the header

NEXT STEPS:
1) split main.js into 2 js.  one for index.html the other for detail page (i.e. designer)
2) complete career path map
3) refract HTML so all <li> are JS driven instead of hard code
4) revisit serch box code and css so it can be more of a component
5) convert all to React.js
  
I welcome your feedback.
